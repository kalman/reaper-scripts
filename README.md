This is a collection of Reaper scripts I wrote for my game sound design workflow.

### CopySelectedTrackNameToChildren

The track name of the selected track is copied to each of its children.

### MoveSelectedItemsToChildTracks

Each selected item is copied to a new child track of that item's track, aligned with the first selected item.

### MoveSelectedItemsToDuplicateTracks

Each selected item is copied into a new track (with the same levels/plugins/etc) then placed at the same time position as the first selected item. Similar to MoveSelectedItemsToChildTracks.
